# GulpRoast_Responsive
Creating a responsive design for Gulp Roast Coffee shop for desktop, tablet, mobile

Challenge:
In this challenge, you will create a responsive website design for a fictitious coffee company’s website that includes a home page, an about page, and a products page. Responsive website designs with grid-based layouts, media queries, and images that resize are a standard of modern web design. As a designer, you will create designs that support your users no matter what devices they are using to access your content. By creating a responsive website design, you’ll gain a greater understanding of how developers use the same content to create different designs. This understanding may impact your workflow and how you communicate with developers in the future.

Background:
Gulp Roast Coffee sells whole-bean and ground coffee to retail customers (B2C) as well as wholesale customers (B2B), such as restaurants. Currently, individuals can purchase coffee from one Gulp Roast Coffee storefront, from retailers (grocery stores), and from farmers’ markets. You’ve been working as a researcher on Gulp’s UX design team to help the company redesign its website. In the previous module, you structured and styled the about page of Gulp Roast’s site as part of this redesign.
For this challenge, you will take the next steps with that design to make the page responsive. You’ve been given Figma files that show what the site will look like on mobile, tablet, and desktop dimensions. Using these, you’ll create two other responsive pages for the site (home page and products page) and link all three pages together for a complete site.
